<h1>Assignment 4: File Systems</h1>

<b>Deadline: <u>11th November, 2012 (IST) </u></b> 
<br> <br>
A <b>penalty of 100% per day</b> would be imposed for late submission.
<br><br>
This assignment is to be implemented in <b>three</b> person teams.


<h2>Objective</h2>

The file system provided in Pintos, among others, has the following deficiencies:
<li>Fixed File Sizes: File sizes are fixed at creation-time, that cannot be changed thereafter</li>
<li>No subdirectories: Pintos has a flat filesystem, not allowing the creation of subdirectories.
</li><li>Files need to be stored contiguously, that can lead to external fragmentation</li>
<!--<li>No synchronization among file-system routines</li>-->

<br><br>

All the above definiciencies must be addressed to:
<li>Implement an indexed filesystem so that files can grow; this will also address the problem of external fragmentation. Provide for direct, indirect and doubly indirect blocks.
</li><li>Allow for hierarchical subdirectories; this will need the implementation of the following system-calls: <br>
<tt>
	int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode); <br>
	int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct old_linux_dirent *dirp, unsigned int count); <br>
	int chdir(const char *path); <br>
</tt>
See the Unix man-pages for details on these calls.
</li><li>Provide for a buffer cache: the buffer cache must be checked before visiting the disk.


<br>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

The Assignment is to be submitted in <tt>{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}.tar.gz</tt> format. The compressed file should contain following -
<ul>
<li><b>Source Code: </b>Complete Pintos source code <b><i>after cleaning off all binaries</i></b> (<b><i>do not include the simulators</i></b>). 
The directory structure inside the archive should be "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/code/*". Your main program should be saved as "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/newprogs/assignment2.c" inside the archive. 

</li><li><b>Report: </b>A <b><i>maximum of five page</i></b> PDF file that briefly describes a brief summary of POSIX message queues and your implementation in Pintos. The report should be saved as "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/report.pdf".
</li></ul>
<h2>Additional Instructions</h2>
</li><li>The total size of submission <b><i>should not exceed 1MB</i></b>.</li>
<li>The quality of both the source code and the report would affect your marks.</li> 
<li><b><i>Points may be deducted for not following the submission conventions</i></b>.</li>

<b><i>Discussion is healthy, copying is not</i></b>. You are encouraged to discuss the assignments, but you must implement the assignments individually (within your team). It is fairly easy to detect copying automatically. 
<b>If any two submissions are found with "similar" pieces of code, the respective students will be failed in the course (with no concern as to who was the "source").</b> 
It is your responsibility to protect your assignment from copying, and no pleas regarding the same would be heeded to.

<b><i>Bonus Points</i></b> may be awarded for innovative ideas.
