<h1>Assignment 2: Threads</h1>

<b>Deadline: <u>25th September, 2012 (IST) </u></b> 
<br> <br>
A <b>penalty of 20% per day</b> would be imposed for late submission.
<br><br>
This assignment is to be implemented in <b>three</b> person teams.


<h2>Objective</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
Read, understand and summarize the semantics for POSIX threads (pthreads). A good place to begin is <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/">here</a>.

<h3>Part 2</h3>
You are required to implement a subset of the POSIX interface to pthreads in Pintos. The following functions (with the exact prototype as provided in the POSIX interface) must be implemented:
<br>
<tt>
<br>
<table border="3" frame="BOX" rules="NONE">
<tbody><tr><td>
<br>
pthread_create (pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
<br>
<br>
pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
<br>
<br>
pthread_exit (void *status);
<br>
<br>
pthread_cancel (pthread_t thread);
<br>
<br>
pthread_attr_init (pthread_attr_t *attr);
<br>
<br>
pthread_attr_destroy (pthread_attr_t *attr); 
<br>
<br>
pthread_setschedparam (pthread_t thread, int policy, const struct sched_param *param);
<br>
<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</tt>
<br>

The following thread attributes <b>must</b> be implemented: detachstate, inheritsched, schedpolicy. The following scheduling policies <b>must</b> be implemented: SCHED_FCFS, SCHED_RR, SCHED_PRIORITY.

Note that the above functions must be implemented as system calls in Pintos. 

<h3>Part 3</h3>
Use your (above) implementation and your implementation of message queues (in assignment #1) to solve the Producer-Consumer problem (discussed in class).


<h2>Deliverables</h2>

The Assignment is to be submitted in <tt>{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}.tar.gz</tt> format. The compressed file should contain following -
<ul>
<li><b>Source Code: </b>Complete Pintos source code <b><i>after cleaning off all binaries</i></b> (<b><i>do not include the simulators</i></b>). 
The directory structure inside the archive should be "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/code/*". Your main program should be saved as "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/newprogs/assignment2.c" inside the archive. 

</li><li><b>Report: </b>A <b><i>maximum of five page</i></b> PDF file that briefly describes a brief summary of POSIX message queues and your implementation in Pintos. The report should be saved as "{rollnumber1_rollnumber2_rollnumber3}/pintos/report.pdf".
</li></ul>
<h2>Additional Instructions</h2>
<li>The total size of submission <b><i>should not exceed 1MB</i></b>.</li>
<li>The quality of both the source code and the report would affect your marks.</li> 
<li><b><i>Points may be deducted for not following the submission conventions</i></b>.</li>

<br>
<table border="3" frame="BOX" rules="NONE">
<tbody><tr><td>
<b><i>Discussion is healthy, copying is not</i></b>. You are encouraged to discuss the assignments, but you must implement the assignments individually (within your team). It is fairly easy to detect copying automatically. 
<b>If any two submissions are found with "similar" pieces of code, the respective students will be failed in the course (with no concern as to who was the "source").</b> 
It is your responsibility to protect your assignment from copying, and no pleas regarding the same would be heeded to.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<br>

<b><i>Bonus Points</i></b> may be awarded for innovative ideas.


<h2>Effort declaration</h2>
You need to provide a declaration of the effort you put in this assignment. For the same, you must fill in the entry corresponding to assignment #1 and carry it to your viva. The effort declaration form can be found <a href="http://web.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/subhajit/courses/CS330_Jul2012/EffortSheet.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Submission details</h2>
Submit it <a href="http://web.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/cs330/upload.html">here</a>.
<!--You should mail your submission (as per the guidelines provided above) <b>to your assigned TA</b>. (Each team will be assigned a TA who will perform the grading of your submissions.)-->

<h2>Queries</h2>
Feel free to contact me (in person or via email) or meet your TAs about any queries that you may have.
